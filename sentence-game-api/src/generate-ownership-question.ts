Generate one multiple-choice challenge question for a game about ownership and sharing. The gameâ€™s theme is:
"Ideology of ownership and sharing, connection on real life activities; telling the truth gives extra points, however an ugly truth is punished with a task. Participation of neighbors and friends is encouraged."
The challenge question should test the player's understanding of these values. The question must have exactly 4 answer choices. Exactly one choice must be the best (correct) answer that aligns with the ideal of honest sharing and responsible ownership. Each answer choice should be output as a JSON object with two keys: "text" (the choice string) and "isCorrect" (a boolean, true only for the correct answer).  
Return the entire result as a JSON object wrapped within a key named "ownershipChallenge" with two properties:
- "question": A string representing the challenge question.
- "choices": An array of 4 answer choice objects.
Return only the JSON object with no additional commentary.
